### 5. Usage

#### Creating a Simple Website:

You can create a simple website by writing a `miniweblang` file:

```miniweblang
page(
  title = "My Baby Website",
  lang = "en"
) {
  head {
    meta(charset = "UTF-8")
    meta(name = "viewport", content = "width=device-width, initial-scale=1")
    link(rel = "stylesheet", href = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css")
  }
  body(class = "bg-gray-100 text-center py-10") {
    h1(class = "text-4xl font-bold text-blue-600") "Welcome to My Baby Website!"
    p(class = "mt-4 text-gray-700") "This is a simple website using MiniWebLang with Tailwind CSS."
    button(class = "mt-6 px-6 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-full hover:bg-blue-700") "Click Me!"
  }
}
```

This code will generate a fully styled HTML file using Tailwind CSS.

---

### 6. How It Works

- **Transpilation Process**: The `MiniWebLang` syntax is processed by a basic interpreter that converts it into standard HTML with embedded Tailwind classes.
- **Node.js** or any similar environment is used to run the interpreter and generate the final HTML output.
